# NumPy
Make sure you have NumPy installed.
The library documentation for NumPy is at: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html

The NumPy library is helpful in working with large multidimensional arrays and matrices, where all elements are of the same type (int, float, etc).

NumPy can help with statistical analysis with functions like mean, median, and standard deviation.
